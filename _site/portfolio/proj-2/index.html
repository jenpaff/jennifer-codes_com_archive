<p><strong>Description:</strong> It started out as a “just-for-fun” project, in order to improve my coding skills, when a friend approached me with the following problem: Every fortnight they gather data for the management meeting to present the latest numbers- isn’t there a way to create an automated reporting system? 
Starting off as that, Port To Success, a Java-based Web Application including various modules, in order to facilitate medium-sized companies and help automate their internal processes. Modules include a reporting platform, personnel database and billing support.</p>
