<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Yes I can develop pieces of software, but how do I design and set up a software and database, configure a server, deploy regularly, liase with the client, organise meetings, test and fix bugs? Working as a freelancer on my own project in my freetime has been both stressful and rewarding. Thank god, I just love coding!</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> It started out as a “just-for-fun” project on the side when a friend approached me with the following problem: Every fortnight they gather data for the management meeting to present the latest numbers- isn’t there a way to create an automated reporting system? 
Eventually, I developed Port To Success, a Java-based Web Application including various modules, in order to facilitate medium-sized companies and help automate their internal processes. Modules include a reporting platform, personnel database and billing support.</p>
