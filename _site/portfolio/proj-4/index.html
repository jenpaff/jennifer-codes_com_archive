<p><strong>Description:</strong> Cited from their website: “It’s important to know that you are not alone. Systers is a forum for all women involved in the technical aspects of computing. The community has over 6,000 members from at least 60 countries around the world. We welcome the participation of women technologists of all ages and at any stage of their studies or careers. Systers is the world’s largest email community of women in technical roles in computing. It was founded by Anita Borg in 1987 together with 12 other women as a small electronic mailing list for women in “systems”.</p>

<p>Anita’s vision in creating Systers in 1987 was to “increase the number of women in computer science and make the environments in which women work more conducive to their continued participation in the field.”</p>

<p>Systers continues to serve this purpose by providing women a private space to seek advice from their peers, and discuss the challenges they share as women technologists. Many Systers members credit the list for helping them make good career decisions, and steering them through difficult professional situations.”</p>
