<p><strong>Description:</strong> Raiffeisen is one of the largest banks in Austria, with Raiffeisen Bausparkasse being a subsidiary specialising on financing. Since the company was planning moving its database, one of the many tasks during my first technical internship was to develop testing scripts in Python and Bash to verify ETL processes were carried out correctly. I was taught basics of Database Design and Architecture. Further, I was able to familiarize myself working in an UNIX environment and quickly learnt how to programme in a Linux Shell. I further helped developing a new printing API using Java, as well as fixed bugs on the go. Finally, I developed a new way to create the monthly bank reports using Penthao BI products.</p>
