title: Google Summer Of Code Student and Mentor
---

<strong>Abstract:</strong> I was so excited to be able to work at Google Summer of Code for a project under the Anita Borg Institute. Having worked as a student with GSOC, I became a mentor of two projects the following year. The first project I mentored was called "Power Up", which is an educational choose-your-own-adventure game that utilizes a users uploaded curriculum to empower pre-adolescents to take charge of their reproductive health. Since the project just started, it was interesting to being involved in seeing the project grow. The second project I mentored was similar to the one I was working for the year before as a student. The Peace Corps Volunteers in Guyana were looking for methods to share resources within a Deaf Community. One of the ideas was to set up an Ushahidi Crowdmap, as well as testing Google Glass to use for filming and uploading videos or photos. 

<strong>Period:</strong> May 2014 - September 2017

<strong>Description:</strong> 
Ushahidi Crowdmap is a platform used by the Peace Corps Volutneers working in Azerbaijan in order to improve communication and sharing of resources between volunteers across the country. Ushahidi is an adapted online database from Crowdmap Classic and was a first trial to share and access information online. My task was to improve and customize the crowdmap to the PCVs needs and requirements. We were aiming to improve the online platform in its usability and user experience and  to make it possible for the PCVs to better coordinate their efforts and to share up-to-date resources with each other. 
PowerUp is an educational choose-your-own-adventure game that utilizes a users uploaded curriculum to empower pre-adolescents to take charge of their reproductive health. This is the Android version of the game. The IOS and Android team worked closely and simultaneously on the project.
