title: Google Summer Of Code 2015
---

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Having worked as a student the year before, I started volunteering to be a mentor for Google Summer of Code mentoring projects under the Anita Borg Institute - Systers.

<strong>Period:</strong> May 2015 - September 2015

<strong>Description:</strong> I gladly mentored two projects. The first project I mentored was called "Power Up", which is an educational choose-your-own-adventure game that utilizes a users uploaded curriculum to empower pre-adolescents to take charge of their reproductive health. Since the project just started, it was interesting to being involved in seeing the project grow. The second project I mentored was similar to the one I was working for the year before as a student. The Peace Corps Volunteers in Guyana were looking for methods to share resources within a Deaf Community. One of the ideas was to set up an Ushahidi Crowdmap, as well as testing Google Glass to use for filming and uploading videos or photos.
