title: Google Summer Of Code 2014
---

<strong>Abstract:</strong> I was so excited to be able to work at Google Summer of Code for a project under the Anita Borg Institute. 

<strong>Period:</strong> May 2014 - September 2014

<strong>Description:</strong> Ushahidi Crowdmap is a platform used by the Peace Corps Volutneers working in Azerbaijan in order to improve communication and sharing of resources between volunteers across the country. Ushahidi is an adapted online database from Crowdmap Classic and was a first trial to share and access information online. My task was to improve and customize the crowdmap to the PCVs needs and requirements. We were aiming to improve the online platform in its usability and user experience and  to make it possible for the PCVs to better coordinate their efforts and to share up-to-date resources with each other.
